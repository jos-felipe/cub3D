This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.


Roadmap:

✓ Scene parsing (completed)
✓ Window management (completed)
👉 Player movement and collision (current step)
Ray-casting engine
Texture mapping
Final touches (minimap, optimization)
