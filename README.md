This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.


Roadmap:

âœ“ Scene parsing (completed)

âœ“ Window management (completed)

Player movement and collision 

Ray-casting engine (completed)

âœ“ Texture mapping (current step)

ðŸ‘‰ Final touches

The engine expects texture files to be in PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format, which provides high-quality images with support for transparency. Each texture must have exact dimensions of 64 by 64 pixels.
